# Savings Jar

A cute, interactive savings tracker to help me save â‚¹10,000!  
The jar fills up with green notes every time I save money, and I can track my progress in a fun, visual way.

## âœ¨ Features

- Green notes drop into the jar with a soft bounce animation.
- Current savings amount updates dynamically.
- Celebration message (and maybe confetti!) when I hit â‚¹10,000.
- Minimal, aesthetic design with pastel vibes.
- Hosted on **GitHub Pages** so I can check my progress anytime!
